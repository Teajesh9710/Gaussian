# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
```
Step 1: Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation

Step 2: Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()

Step 3: Using the np.linalg.solve(), we can find the solutions.

Step 4: End the program.
```
